United Defenders League Uniform Code of Conduct
================================

1. [Principles](#principles)

Principles
-------------------------

# The Pledge of Scarlet

The definitive statement of UDL principles and values is the Pledge of Scarlet, the oath expected of all Merrymen.

> I, `Applicant`, pledge to see with all my faculties of morality; to be incorruptible as a symbol of good in the face of intense adversaries; to atone any historical misconduct; to be a person rightfully known as one to trust when one needs ephectic assistance, defense and sound guidance; to defend with probity, native communities from insecurity, intimidation and terror on condition said communities do not will otherwise.
> 
> I heed a calling of absolute duty, for which I wear my quiver of truth and justice. I shall strive to meet the duty of this audacious calling, since I acknowledge that the virtuous need duty as much as the duties of the world need the virtuous to serve them.
> 
> I solemnly pledge to commit myself to The United Defenders League as a servant of the good.

This Code of Conduct is a handbook of how to meet the demands of this oath, as well as rules for the Militia and for handling misconduct.

# Morality

1. It is the foundational principle of the UDL that regions belong to their native residents.
2. A "native" is a nation that resides in the region long-term, where the owner of that nation considers that region to be home. [From old OSRS](http://web.archive.org/web/20050521153957/http://forums.jolt.co.uk/showthread.php?t=301703) 
3. A "non-native" is the catch-all designation for any nations that aren't natives. The "native" and "non-native" sets are all-inclusive and mutually-exclusive; a nation must be one or the other, not both, and not neither. Spies residing in a region long-term and working for an outside force are not natives. [From old OSRS](http://web.archive.org/web/20050521153957/http://forums.jolt.co.uk/showthread.php?t=301703) 
4. A player can have multiple native nations native to multiple regions, so long as their intention is not to further an outside force.
5. When non-natives change the Delegacy of a region, it is an invasion.
6. Invasions take away the right of the natives to control their region.

# Incorruptibility: We in tights do not Invade

1. All members of the UDL are expected to refrain from invading, even separately from their participation in the UDL.
2. The only exception is participation in a war in which both sides are active participants on behalf of your home.
3. Regions whose theme or membership is egregious are not exempt. [http://s4.zetaboards.com/UDL/topic/9829200/1/](Even Nazi regions.)

# Incorruptibility: We in tights do not {word for corrupting regional politics}

1. The involvement of non-natives in a region in order to further outside goals is wrong, including on offsite forums and including our goals.
2. Involvement in a region to further its defense is not action to further outside goals.
3. Intelligence Operations must follow a more detailed code of conduct detailed elsewhere.

# Atonement

1. Former invaders who renounce their previous actions are welcome to join the UDL.
2. {more?}

# Trustworthiness and Ephecticness

## Wrath

1. Don't fly off the handle. Seriously.
2. Particularly not on NationStates, it is, after all, a game.
3. If you're really feeling wrathful, walk away from the computer for a bit.

## Conflict of Interest

1. The key to resolving conflicts of interest is transparency.
2. Let the Lieutenants know of any involvement you have that might conflict with the UDL.
3. Let your associates in such involvement know also.
4. In particular if you are in a regional army which is not purely a defender army, you should keep the UDL aware you are in it and keep that army aware that you are in UDL, and inform them of how you are managing the two sets of duties.

## Honor

1. As the good guys, we're expected to be honorable.
2. Meeting this expectation allows us to do what we do with the support of the NationStates Community.
3. Honesty is to be preferred and no statement on behalf of the UDL or defenders everywhere should be dishonest.

# Defense

1. We seek to defend regions which are invaded except for a limited list of regions we have determined that we do not wish to help, including the Greater German Reich, NAZI EUROPE, and The Ascendancy.
2. If the natives of a region ask us to leave, or ask us to refrain from defending them, we will comply as it is for their sake that we defend in the first place.

 
Comprehensive Prohibitions
-------------------------

1. No member of the UDL may invade (except in a mutual war between two regions).
2. Forum Destruction is prohibited, and unrepentant forum destroyers are unwelcome.
3. Personal privacy must be respected: the publication of information such as real names, IP addresses, real addresses, email addresses, occupations, obsessions or anything else which could be used to find the actual person, or if is more about them as people then about nationstates, it prohibited.
4. There is to be no cracking of any 
5. The release of any confidential UDL information such as operational planning is a betrayal of trust and prohibited.
